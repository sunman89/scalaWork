Week 05 = Question 2.(b)

What happens when we define a companion object for a case class?
It becomes a singleton instance/object. Allowing us to set a constructor only one time.
And allows us to use factory methods and pattern matching.
It works like static methods and fields in Java by allowing us to access fields without instantiasing the class.
