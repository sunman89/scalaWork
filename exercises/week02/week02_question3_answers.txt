The current responsibilities of pollSensors() method are:

It initialises the sensors into a listBuffer for each sensor type. By creating a new instance of the sensors (FireSensor and SmokeSensor) classes.
It then iterates through the list of the sensors using a for loop.
Each sensor in the list is then checked if that sensor has been triggered via calling the isTriggered method on that sensor.
If it is triggered, the system prints out a message included the sensor type which it gets via the method getSensorType and it gets the location of which that sensor was triggered. Prints on a single line.
However if the sensor was not triggered, it prints a message saying that sensor was polled, gets the sensor type and location adn displays the message on a single line.
