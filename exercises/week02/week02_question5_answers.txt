The new responsibilities of pollSensors() method are:

It now just loops through the collection/list of the sensors and checks each one using a for loop.
Therefore it now just does one thing and that is loops throught the sensors checking if they are triggered.

Each sensor in the list is then checked if that sensor has been triggered via calling the isTriggered method on that sensor.

If it is triggered, the system prints out a message included the sensor type which it gets via the method getSensorType and it gets the location of which that sensor was triggered. Prints on a single line.
However if the sensor was not triggered, it prints a message saying that sensor was polled, gets the sensor type and location adn displays the message on a single line.
