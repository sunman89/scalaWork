Question 3
When is it appropriate to use the Abstract Factory Design pattern?



When creating an abstract factory for multiple concrete factories, Which will inherit the necessary information from the abstract factory. 
It is appropriate to do this when designing concrete factories that are very similiar but have a slight difference, so will need to contain pretty much all the same data/information except maybe a few fields or methods. Therefore you would need an abstract factory that contains the information that is shared between the concrete factories.
